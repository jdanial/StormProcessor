# StormProcessor
This is a faster implementation of [DeepSinse](https://github.com/jdanial/DeepSinse). Download the files `neuralNetwork.mat` and `stormProcessing` as well as the `Particle Fitter` and `Drift Correction` folders in a folder of your choice and run `stormProcessing`.
## Dependencies
StormProcessor is dependent on the Redundant Cross-Correlation (RCC) algorithm (https://github.com/yinawang28/RCC) and Cpufit (https://github.com/gpufit/Gpufit). The relevant files from these 2 dependencies are included.
